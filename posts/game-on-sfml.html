    <h1>Game On! SFML Edition</h1>
    <p class="muted">2026-02-02. Morning</p>
    <p>My friend Adilet is making a game using SFML, and I am excited to share the journey with you all!</p>
    <p>SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) is a powerful library that provides a simple interface to various multimedia components, making it easier to create games and multimedia applications. Adilet has chosen SFML for its ease of use, performance, and flexibility.</p>
    <p>As Adilet embarks on this game development journey, I will be documenting the process and sharing insights, challenges, and progress along the way.</p>
    <p>Stay tuned for updates as Adilet brings his game to life with SFML!</p>
