Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a simple, personal space on the web where I can share my thoughts without any distractions or corporate nonsense.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Programming and technology
- My projects and experiments
- Random thoughts and ideas
- Whatever interests me

## The Philosophy

This site is built with simplicity in mind. Pure HTML, CSS, and Jekyll for static site generation. No tracking, no ads, no JavaScript bloat. Just honest content.

Thanks for visiting!
